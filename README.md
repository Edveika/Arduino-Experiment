# üö® Arduino-LED

Just playing around with Arduino and LEDs.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

For some reason `digitalWrite` with the value of `HIGH` turns the LED off on my board and the `LOW` value turns the LED on, even though on Arduino's site it says that it should work in the opposite way.

* Turn **OFF** LED:

```c++
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
```
* Turn **ON** LED:

```c++
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
```

# üß† Ideas

1. Get RGB LEDs and use sorting algorithms to sort LEDs by color(visualize sorting algs)
